   abstract = {The ground state of the antiferromagnetic (formula presented) model with a kagomé lattice is known to be characterized by a well developed accidental degeneracy. As a consequence the phase transition in this system consists in unbinding of pairs of fractional vortices. Addition of the next-to-nearest neighbor (NNN) interaction leads to stabilization of the long-range order in chirality (or staggered chirality). We show that the phase transition, related with destruction of this long-range order, can happen as a separate phase transition below the temperature of the fractional vortex pairs unbinding only if the NNN coupling is extremely weak, and find how the temperature of this transition depends on coupling constants. We also demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic ordering of chiralities and, accordingly, the presence of the second phase transition are induced by the free energy of spin wave fluctuations even in absence of the NNN coupling. © 2002 The American Physical Society.},

The XY model (n=2) in the zero-temperature (T0) limit reduces to the three-state Potts model, which in turn can be mapped onto a solid-on-solid model that is o/Iat its roughening transition. Exact critical exponents are derived for this system. The spins in the Heisenberg model (n=3) become coplanar and more ordered than the XY model as T0.

   abstract = {Possible Néel orderings of antiferromagnetically coupled spins on a kagomé lattice are studied using linear-spin-wave theory and high-temperature expansions. Spin-wave analysis, applied to q=0 (three spins per magnetic unit cell) and to 3 × 3 (nine spins per cell) Néel orderings yield identical excitation spectra with twofold-degenerate linear modes and a dispersionless zero-energy mode. This dispersionless mode is equivalent to an excitation localized to an arbitrary hexagon of nearest-neighbor spins. Second- (J2) and third- (J3) neighbor interactions are shown to stabilize the q=0 state for J2>J3 and the 3 × 3 state for J2<J3. A high-temperature expansion of the spin-spin susceptibility ±(q) is performed to order 1/T8, for n-component, classical spins with nearest-neighbor interactions only. To order 1/T7 the largest eigenvalue of the susceptibility matrix is found to be independent of wave vector with an eigenvector that corresponds to the dispersionless mode of the ordered phase. This degeneracy is removed at order 1/T8. For n=0, the q=0 mode is favored; for n=1, the band is flat; and, for n>1, the maximum susceptibility is found for a 3 × 3 excitation. Similar results are found for the three-dimensional pyrochlore lattice. The high-temperature expansion is used to interpret experimental data for the uniform susceptibility and powder-neutron-diffraction spectrum for the kagomé-lattice system SrCr8-xGa4+xO19. © 1992 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {The asymptotic behavior of the correlations in the low-temperature phase are found for the following two-dimensional quantum systems: a two-dimensional lattice of plane rotators, two-dimensional magnetic substances having an easy plane of magnetization, a two-dimensional Bose liquid (Sec. 1), and a two-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg ferromagnet (Sec. 2). The nature of the change of the asymptotic behavior with increasing temperature is investigated for the systems considered in Sec. 1. The nature of the change of the asymptotic behavior with increasing temperature is investigated for the systems considered in Sec. 1. The nature of the low-temperature phase consists in the superfluidity of a two-dimensional Bose liquid; the corresponding property can also be formulated in terms of magnetic substances. IN the previous article[ 1 J by the author, the correlation functions were determined at low temperatures in two-dimensional systems of classical spins and in other two-dimensional systems possessing a continuous symmetry group. In the present article similar results are derived for two-dimensional quantum systems: in Sec. 1 the correlations are investigated in a two-dimensional lattice of planar rotators, in a two-dimensional Bose liquid, and in planar magnetic substances (these three problems are equivalent), and in Sec. 2 the correlations in a two-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet are investigated. To within quantities of the order of the cutoff parameter ro, these correlations coincide with the correlations in classical systems, which were found inUJ. The nature of the temperature-dependent corrections to the found expressions is briefly described in Sec. 1, and the question of the nature of the low-temperature phase, which was treated incorrectly in arti-cle[1J, is touched upon: The characteristic of the low-temperature phase is not an infinite susceptibility, as was erroneously asserted in.C 1 J, but rather the super-fluidity of a two-dimensional Bose liquid and the corresponding property of two-dimensional magnetic substances. The author hopes to return to this question, too. One-dimensional systems are not considered in this article. 1.

As the anisotropy decreases, both critical temperatures steeply decrease, while the BKT critical region becomes divergently wide. We elucidate a sharp "V shape" of the phase diagram around the isotropic Heisenberg point, which suggests that the isotropic case is exceptionally singular and that the associated Z2 vortex transition will be isolated from the BKT and chiral transitions.
